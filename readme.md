# Vega Capsule
Use Vega Capsule to create an instance of the Vega network on your computer to experiment with using the protocol. 
* Become familiar with Vega, and run commands and API scripts in a controlled environment
* Try out liquidity strategies locally before using the public testnet
* Practice with the market creation process, to make sure proposals will be accepted for a vote
* Simulate network conditions ahead of putting forward a network configuration change proposal
* Simulate market conditions or price scenarios without being concerned about unexpected user behaviour

## Quick start

### Pre-start
1. Make sure you have Go 1.17+ installed locally. [Get Go](https://go.dev/doc/install).
```bash
go version
```

1. Make sure Docker is running on your machine. [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
```bash
docker version
```

2. Install vegacapsule
- Clone Capsule repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:vegaprotocol/vegacapsule.git
git config --global url."git@github.com:vegaprotocol".insteadOf "https://github.com/vegaprotocol"
cd vegacapsule
```
- Build Capsule from source
```bash
go install
```
- Validate Capsule installation
```bash
vegacapsule --help
```

3. #### Install dependepcies
[Install Vega binaries](install_vega_bins.md). Installs **vega**, **data-node** and **vegawallet** binaries on your machine and.

This step can be skipped if network when network is bootstrapped with --install flag. See 

### Start Capsule Network
1. Start nomad
```bash
vegacapsule nomad
```
**Note**: You may need to set the `GOBIN` environment variable to run it.

2. Bootstrap network

In another Terminal window run bootstrap command to generate and start new network.

#### Bootstrap with preinstalled binaries ####
This step requires preinstalled **vega**, **data-node** and **vegawallet** binaries.
Plese refer to [Install Vega binaries](install_vega_bins.md).

```bash
vegacapsule network bootstrap --config-path=net_confs/config.hcl
```

#### Bootstrap with autoinstall ####
Bootstrap with autoinstall will automatically download required binaries as a first step of the process.
Either **--install** or **--install-release-tag** flags can be used. The former installes latest version and the 
latter installes from given release tag.

```bash
vegacapsule network bootstrap --config-path=net_confs/config.hcl --install
```

```bash
vegacapsule network bootstrap --config-path=net_confs/config.hcl --install-release-tag v0.54.0
```

3. Check Nomad console by opening http://localhost:4646/

## Restoring network from checkpoint
### Bootstrapping a new network

1. First generate the network
```bash
vegacapsule network generate --config-path=net_confs/config.hcl
```

2. Run restore command to change networks genesis files
```
vegacapsule nodes restore-checkpoint --checkpoint-file PATH_TO_YOUR_CHECKPOINT_FILE
```

3. Lastly the network can be started. It will load it's state from the checkpoint
```
vegacapsule network start
```

### Restoring on existing network

1. Stop the currently running network first (if the network is running)
```bash
vegacapsule network stop
```

2. Reset current network nodes state
```bash
vegacapsule nodes unsafe-reset-all
```

3. Run restore command to change networks genesis files
```
vegacapsule nodes restore-checkpoint --checkpoint-file PATH_TO_YOUR_CHECKPOINT_FILE
```

4. Lastly the network can be started. It will load it's state from the checkpoint
```
vegacapsule network start
```

## Logs

Logs from all jobs are stored by default to $CAPSULE_HOM/logs. There is a CLI availible to read them.

To read all logs per single job:
```
vegacapsule logs --job-id $JOBID
```

To follow all logs per job:
```
vegacapsule logs --job-id $JOBID --follow
```

For more information please check
```
vegacapsule logs --help
```

## Depositing/staking & minting of Ethereum assets

Please note following commands are only for Ethereum assets.
All availible assets can be listed on Data Node REST API under `$DATA_NODE_URL/assets`.

### Examples

Variables used in examples:

`PUB_KEY` - public key to deposit or stake to.

`AMOUNT` - the amount the be deposited, staked or minted.

`ASSET_SYMBOL` - symbol of the asset to be deposited, staked or minted. It can be found via the Data Node endpoint above.

`ETH_ADDR` - Ethereum adddress for assets to be minted to.

```bash
# Deposit asset to specific Vega key
vegacapsule ethereum asset deposit --amount $AMOUNT --asset-symbol $ASSET_SYMBOL --pub-key $PUB_KEY

# Stake asset to specific Vega key
vegacapsule ethereum asset stake --amount $AMOUNT --asset-symbol $ASSET_SYMBOL --pub-key $PUB_KEY

# Mint asset to specific Ethereum address
vegacapsule ethereum asset mint --amount $AMOUNT --asset-symbol $ASSET_SYMBOL --to-addr $ETH_ADDR
```

Validating that asset has been deposited on Data Node REST API: `$DATA_NODE_URL/parties/$PUB_KEY/accounts`
Validating that asset has been staked on Data Node REST API: `$DATA_NODE_URL/parties/$PUB_KEY/stake`

## Commands

You can see all available commands calling the `vegacapsule --help` command.

### Examples

```bash
# Generate the network config files
vegacapsule network generate --home-path=/var/tmp/veganetwork/testnetwork --config-path=net_confs/config.hcl

# Starts the network
vegacapsule network start --home-path=/var/tmp/veganetwork/testnetwork

# Stop the network
vegacapsule network stop --home-path=/var/tmp/veganetwork/testnetwork

# Resume the network with previous configurationh
vegacapsule  network start --home-path=/var/tmp/veganetwork/testnetwork

# Destroy the network
vegacapsule network destroy --home-path=/var/tmp/veganetwork/testnetwork
```

> ⚠️ Information:
> Capsule preserves some files when starting and stopping the network, for example any pre-generated keys, the genesis file, and any node configurations in the [network configuration file](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vegacapsule/tree/main/net_confs). In order to start network with new values in these files, use  the `vegacapsule network destroy` command.

### Commands for ethereum network

You can set up the multisig smart contract with the following command:

```bash
vegacapsule ethereum multisig init
```

Procedure executed by the above command:

1. Set threshold to 1
1. Add validators as signers
1. Remove the contract owner from the signers list
1. Set threshold to 667

## Configuration

See [configuration docs](config.md).

### Templating

See [templating docs](templates.md).

### Troubleshooting

#### Missing the `GOBIN` environment variable 

```
Error: GOBIN environment variable has not been found - please set install-path flag instead
```

The error may happen during the `vegacapsule nomad` command. To solve it, set the environment variable with the following command: `export GOBIN="$HOME/go/bin"`.
