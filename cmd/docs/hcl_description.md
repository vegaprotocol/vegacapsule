Capsule configuration is used by vegacapsule CLI network to generate and bootstrap commands.
It allows a user to configure and customise Vega network running on Capsule.

The configuration uses the [HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl) language syntax, which is also used, for example, by [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).
